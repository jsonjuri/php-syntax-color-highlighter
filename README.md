# Credits
This plugin was originally written for Javascript code coloring and was created by [@mallowigi](https://github.com/mallowigi) I have modified the code from [webstorm-js-color-additions repository](https://github.com/justsl/webstorm-js-color-additions) repository to support PHP code coloring in Webstorm.
